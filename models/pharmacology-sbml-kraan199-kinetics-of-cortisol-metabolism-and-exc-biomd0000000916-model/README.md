**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: G P Kraan; N M Drayer; R de Bruin

## Description

A new model is proposed to study the kinetics of [3H]cortisol metabolism by using urinary data only. The model consists of 5 pools, in which changes of the fractions of dose are given by a system of 5


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.
