# Beker2020 - Drug-likeness prediction based on Bayesian neural networks

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2408060002)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: biomodels_ebi

## Description

To define drug-likeness, a set of 2136 approved drugs from DrugBank was taken as drug-like, and three negative datasets were selected from ZINC15 (19M), the Network of Organic Chemistry (6M) and ligan


## Usage

This model was auto-generated from the biomodels_ebi repository.

```yaml
# In a space.yaml wiring file:
