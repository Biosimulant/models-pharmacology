# Pu2019 - eToxPred: an ML-based approach to estimate the toxicity, and synthetic accessibility of drug candidates

**Source**: [biomodels_ebi](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/MODEL2406270007)
**Standard**: sbml
**Authors**: Limeng Pu; Misagh Naderi; Tairan Liu; Hsiao-Chun Wu; Supratik Mukhopadhyay

## Description

The eToxPred tool has been developed to predict, on one hand, the synthetic accessibility (SA) score, or how easy it is to make the molecule in the laboratory, and, on the other hand, the toxicity (To
