# models-pharmacology

Curated collection of **pharmacology** and **pharmacokinetics** simulation models for the **biosim** platform. This repository contains 66 computational models of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME), pharmacodynamics, and drug-target interactions.

## What's Inside

### Models (66 packages)

**Pharmacology** — drug kinetics, pharmacodynamics, and therapeutic modeling:

**Key Areas:** PBPK (physiologically-based pharmacokinetic) models, dose-response relationships, drug metabolism and clearance, receptor binding dynamics, drug-drug interactions, and therapeutic dosing optimization.

All models use SBML format with tellurium runtime.

## Prerequisites
